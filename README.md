## Who is our user?
------------------- 
Home chefs that are restricted greatly by the amount of time and variety of ingredients they have available. 

## What is their problem?
-------------------
They want to quickly find recipes that utilize the ingredients they already have at home. They may also want search for recipes that are quick to complete.


## Our Solution
-------------------
In Your Fridge allows users to input the staple ingredients they always have around the house - these ingredients will be stored in our database so they never have input those again. The user may also input 'Extras', and both of these lists will be used to generate a list of five recipes - ordered by time and title. If the user comes across a recipe they want to save for later, they can easily favorite that recipe and it will be stored for them.
